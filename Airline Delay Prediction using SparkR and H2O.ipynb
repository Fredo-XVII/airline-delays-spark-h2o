    "The airline industry in US is totally a red ocean, there are so many airline carriers competing for very less margin, and new entrants keep increasing. Just like the quotes from CEO of American Airlines, Robert L. Crandall, “This is a nasty, rotten business”.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to stay in the game, airline carriers are constantly striving to improve in many aspects such as customer services, price, food and so on. Among all the complaints from customers, airline delay is obviously the biggest issue, which can potentially be very costly to customers and airline carriers. In fact, with the increasing number of business and leisure travellers, flight delays are becoming a critical issue every airline carrier faces. Carriers who can accurately predict flight delay and plan flights and logistics accordingly will find huge competitive advantages over others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Our group is focusing on predicting the likelihood of flight delays through classification techniques. We are also proposing a methodology to predict the delay at each airport and for each carrier. Through accurate classification and numerical predictions, we can help carriers to manage delays ahead of time and save a lot of unexpected losses. This will enable carriers to plan flights in a smart way and optimize logistics and pricing for flights."
